# RecipeNLG Dataset

## Overview

**RecipeNLG** is a large-scale, structured dataset consisting of over 2.2 million cooking recipes. Developed by researchers from the Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology, it was designed specifically for natural language generation (NLG) tasks within the food domain. RecipeNLG extends the Recipe1M+ dataset with additional cleaning, deduplication, and semantic annotations, making it one of the most comprehensive and high-quality datasets available for research in recipe generation and food-related language modeling.

## Dataset Features

Each recipe in the dataset includes the following structured fields:

- **Title**: The name of the recipe.
- **Ingredients**: A semi-structured list of ingredients, including quantities, units, and ingredient names.
- **Instructions**: A sequence of step-by-step natural language directions for preparing the dish.
- **Named Entities (Optional)**: Some versions of the dataset include food-related named entities, enabling further exploration of semantic relationships between ingredients and cooking steps.

This structured format enables both supervised and unsupervised machine learning workflows for a variety of NLP tasks, including but not limited to sequence-to-sequence generation, named entity recognition, ingredient substitution, and data-to-text generation.

## Motivation and Use Cases

The RecipeNLG dataset addresses limitations found in previous recipe corpora (e.g., noise and inconsistency in Recipe1M+) and provides a robust benchmark for:

- **Sequence-to-sequence instruction generation**  
- **Prompt-based text generation using LLMs**  
- **Entity recognition and ingredient normalization**  
- **Similarity and recommendation systems for recipes and ingredients**  
- **Evaluation of text generation models using BLEU, ROUGE, and other metrics**

## Access and Format

The dataset is available for download on Kaggle:

**Kaggle URL**: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saldenisov/recipenlg](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saldenisov/recipenlg)

**Format**: Comma-separated values (CSV)  
**Size**: ~2.2 million recipes  
**Fields**: `title`, `ingredients`, `instructions`, and optional `NER` annotations

Example usage in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('recipenlg.csv')

# Display sample recipe
print(df.loc[0, 'title'])
print(df.loc[0, 'ingredients'])
print(df.loc[0, 'instructions'])'''
